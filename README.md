## Getting started

To best make use of this repository, click on the "Clone or download" button towards the top-right of the page. Then, click "Download Zip". Use your preferred software to unzip it, and you're ready to go.

## Templates

In the [templates](https://github.com/achyutghosh/Machine-Learning-Tutorial/tree/master/templates) folder, you will find:

- regression templates (python and R)
- classification templates (python and R)
- a cross validation script to compare multiple models (python)
- plot templates, which contain the code to generate a variety of interesting plots.

## Notes

At one stage I was going to write notes for every topic on the Udemy course, but I stopped after a while because I realised that the course was more focused on application than theory. In the [notes](https://github.com/achyutghosh/Machine-Learning-Tutorial/blob/master/notes/1-Preprocessing.md) folder, there are notes on preprocessing and multiple regression (the latter of which is nicely typed in LaTeX).

## Python vs R

Many people who want to know more about machine learning struggle to choose between python and R. I personally believe that python is a better choice, particularly because it is easy to integrate your machine learning model with a wide range of other systems (e.g a web app), and because of the unified machine learning interface provided by `scikit-learn`. Take a look in the templates to judge for yourself.

I have included a full discussion in this repository, [`python_vs_R.md`](https://github.com/achyutghosh/Machine-Learning-Tutorial/blob/master/Python_vs_R.md), which includes comments on the ease/quality of the implementation of various algorithms in each language.
